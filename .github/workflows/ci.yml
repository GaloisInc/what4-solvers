  # Indicates sufficient CI success for the purposes of mergify merging the pull
  # request, see .github/mergify.yml. This is done instead of enumerating each
  # instance of each job in the mergify configuration for a number of reasons:
  # - continue-on-error is respected, won't block merge
  # - changes to jobs or job instances don't require a mergify config update
  # - dependencies through `needs:` are validated, CI will fail if it's invalid
